# Mythic Emporium
This is the biggest personal project I've done thus far. I learned Typescript and Next.js through this project and got some exposure to MongoDB as well as the general concept behind how user credentials are stored and authenticated in the backend.

### Description
Users are able to explore the various fictitious products displayed on the website. To grant the users more ease in discovering certain products, a filtering system and a searching function were implemented. 

As the administrator, I am able to sign in with user authentication from the backend and access a simple inventory management system. The site also supports auto-login from an automatically stored login token, but that isn't relevant to regular users. The inventory management system features 4 types of operations:

1. Adding a new product
2. Editing the information of an existing product
3. Removing an existing product
4. Viewing all the existing products

Here are a gif showing the inventory management system in action:
