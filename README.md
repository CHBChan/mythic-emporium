# Mythic Emporium
This is the biggest personal project I've done. I learned Typescript and Next.js through this project and got some exposure to MongoDB as well as the general concept behind how user credentials are stored and authenticated in the backend. 

### Description
Users are able to explore the various fictitious products displayed in the website. To grant the users more ease in discovering certain products, a filtering system and a searching function was implemented. 

As the administrator, I am able to sign in with user authentication from the backend and access a simple inventory management system. The inventory management system features 4 types of operations:

1. Adding a new product
2. Editing the information of an existing product
3. Removing an existing product
4. Viewing all the existing products
